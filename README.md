# Microsoft Movie Studio Recommendation

## Overview

This project analyzes movie data in order to create a portfolio strategy for entrance into the Entertainment industry.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data

In the folder [zippedData](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project/tree/master/zippedData) are movie datasets from:

- Box Office Mojo (Links to an external site.)
- IMDB (Links to an external site.)
- Rotten Tomatoes (Links to an external site.)
- TheMovieDB (Links to an external site.)
- The Numbers

In the data directory, cleaned data was submitted with the github repo along with more data scraped from The Numbers

## Methods

From the Production Budget perspective and WorldWide Gross perspective, recent data was pinpointed to focus on successful movies in the medium budget range.
- Medium Range of Production Budgets 2M USD to 80M then capped at 65M
- Whose ROI% was greater than 150% or 2.5 times the investment
- Only recent movies since 2010
- Comparing MPAA Ratings and investigating Sources of Content



## Results

Initial movie data shows that 65% of all movies are not successful.  We looked at the 533 which had an ROI% of >= 150%
